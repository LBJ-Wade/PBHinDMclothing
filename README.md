# PBHinDMclothing

So far, I only have some notes and plots to calculate the distribution of peri-BH and compare with the typical size of the DM halo around each BH.

Notes so far are [here](https://github.com/bradkav/PBHinDMclothing/blob/master/notes/PBH-notes.pdf).

The jupyter notebook with the code can be viewed (in-browser) [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bradkav/PBHinDMclothing/blob/master/code/PBH.ipynb).
